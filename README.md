Project Highlights:

Geometric Calculations: Designed and implemented a Java program to perform various geometric calculations related to circles, such as computing the area, circumference, and diameter.
Object-Oriented Principles: Employed object-oriented programming principles to ensure the code is modular, reusable, and maintainable.
Key Features:

User Input Handling: Designed a user-friendly input system to accept radius values and validate them.
Comprehensive Methods: Provided multiple methods to calculate area, circumference, and diameter based on the given radius.
Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully.
This project enhanced my understanding of object-oriented design and geometric computations, enabling me to create flexible and reusable code structures.
