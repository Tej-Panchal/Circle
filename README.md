This Project is about Center, Radius and the Area of the Circle  First of all we have to declare 2 Center to get an output,   After that we have find the radius and Area of the Circle.   Then When we find all of that , we have to compare all of the   center to eachother and let the user know which center equals  to which center and which not.
